# NATURO INTELLIGENT FARMING
<p align="justify"> It which takes into consideration all the appropriate parameters including temperature, rainfall, location and soil condition, to predict crop suitability. This system provides crop recommendations to farmers using machine learning algorithms. </p>


# ABSTRACT
<p align="justify"> In today’s era technology is playing a vital role in different sectors to overcome the difficulties and to have better and maximum results. The farming sector has a huge impact on Indian economy. Half of the country’s population is still employed in the agriculture sector. Agriculture is largely influenced by natural conditions of its surroundings and hence farmer faces number of challenges in actual farming practices. The Indian agriculture sector is adopting the technical aspects but the rate is very slow. It is observed that farmers tend to sow the crop according to its market value and possible financial profits rather than taking into the account factors like soil conditions, weather conditions etc. that leads to undesirable results. The emerging technologies like Machine learning and deep learning will result as a game changer in helping the agronomist if used in proper manner. This report will represent use of supervised machine learning to improvise the farming. The major goal of this project is to provide the generic prerequisites required for growing a crop. </p>


# Steps involved in implementation:
- Data cleaning and wrangling
- Split the data into training and test data sets.
- Data pre-processing.
- Feature selection.
- Model selection.
- Model validation.
- Interpret the results.
- Get the best model and check it against test data set.

# Objective of project
- Provide recommendation of the best suitable crops in the area so that the farmer does not incur any losses.
- To learn different supervised machine learning algorithms.
- To compare efficiency for a particular scenario by using different algorithms.

# Machine Learning algorithm used in the recommendation system is:
## Random Forests: 
<p align="justify"> It is a supervised Machine learning algorithm used for classification, regression, and other tasks using decision trees. The Random Forest classifier creates a set of decision trees from a randomly selected subset of the training set. It is basically a set of decision trees (DT) from a randomly selected subset of the training set and then It collects the votes from different decision trees to decide the final prediction. </p>

# Conclusion
<p align="justify"> This system helps the farmer to choose the right crop by providing insights that ordinary farmers don't keep track of thereby decreasing the chances of crop failure and increasing productivity. It also prevents them from incurring losses. The system can be extended to the web and can be accessed by millions of farmers across the country. We could achieve an accuracy of 99.31% percent from the Random Forest Classifier. Further development is to integrate the crop recommendation system with another subsystem, yield predictor that would also provide the farmer an estimate of production if he plants the recommended crop. </p>
